Motivation:
====


why Angular ?
------
- ?

fast
-----
- Easy to create a fast(Responsive) interface.
- less code: bind html element using declerative syntax rather then a hacking/manipulating the dom.

testing
----
- built with testing in mind.

meaningful + expressive html 
----- 
- named tags makes markup readable . (easier to understand the app behaviour and intent)
- work with a more flexible dom - with our defined markup
